 * service checks every request with RateLimiter::allow() and records
 * rejections in AccessLog; the serial menu shows the log.

/**
 * @brief Token bucket per source address, plus shared buckets for untrusted and trusted sources
 *
 * Each source may send `burst` requests at once and then `ratePerSecond` on
 * average. Sources are tracked in a small table; when it is full, the source
 * seen least recently is replaced and the new one starts with a full bucket.
 *
 * Because of that, rotating or spoofed source addresses (trivial with UDP)
 * would each get a fresh bucket. The global bucket caps all untrusted
 * sources together, no matter how many appear.
 *
 * Sources that sent a request with the right community can be marked trusted
 * (markTrusted). They draw from a separate shared trusted bucket instead, so
 * a flood from unauthenticated addresses cannot starve a real manager. Trust
 * is limited, because the community may be the well-known default or be
 * sniffed (SNMPv1 sends it in clear text):
 *   - the trusted bucket caps all trusted sources together
 *   - at most `maxTrusted` sources are trusted at once
 *   - trust expires after `trustTimeoutMs` without requests; every allow()
 *     sweeps the whole table, so idle sources release their slots
 *   - clearTrust() revokes all trust, e.g. when the community changes
 * Trusted sources are evicted from the table only when no untrusted entry is
 * left. A request refused by its source bucket takes no shared token.
 *
 * Time comes from millis() on a single core and only moves forward; a gap
 * long enough to fill a bucket (including more than 2^31 ms) fills it.
