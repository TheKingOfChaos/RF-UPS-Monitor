/**
 * @file dhcp_option.h
 * @brief Request and read one extra DHCP option by editing and reading Ethernet frames.
 *
 * The core's lwIP is precompiled without DHCP hooks, so it neither asks for
 * nor keeps site-specific options. The firmware sees every frame at the
 * driver (src/net_stats.cpp), so it
 *  - adds the option code to the Parameter Request List (option 55) of every
 *    outgoing DISCOVER/REQUEST/INFORM, in place, using a padding byte after
 *    the END option (lwIP always pads), and fixes the UDP checksum;
 *  - reads the option from incoming DHCPACKs addressed to this device.
 *
 * Pure C++, host tested with frames captured from the device and from Kea.
