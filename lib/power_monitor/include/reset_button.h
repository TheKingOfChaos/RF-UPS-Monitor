/**
 * @file reset_button.h
 * @brief Factory reset button: debounced 10-second hold detection and LED pattern.
 *
 * Pure C++, unit tested on the host. Core 1 feeds it one sample per
 * millisecond (GPIO22, pressed = LOW) and drives the LED from ledOn(), so
 * nothing blocks while the button is held. When the hold time is reached,
 * update() returns Triggered once and core 0 performs the reset.
