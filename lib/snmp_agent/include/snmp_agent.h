/**
 * @file snmp_agent.h
 * @brief SNMP v1 and v2c request handling: Get, GetNext, GetBulk (v2c), Set (rejected).
 *
 * Pure C++, unit tested on the host. The firmware passes each received UDP
 * payload to SnmpAgent::handle() and sends back whatever it returns. Each
 * request is answered in its own version.
 *
 * Both versions:
 *   - Not v1/v2c, malformed, wrong community, or not a request: no response
 *     (counted in SnmpStats)
 *
 * v1 (RFC 1157):
 *   - Get: every OID must name an object, else noSuchName with the 1-based
 *     index of the first unknown varbind
 *   - GetNext: the next object after each OID, noSuchName past the end
 *   - Set: all objects are read-only, answered with noSuchName
 *   - Response larger than the buffer: tooBig with the request varbinds
 *
 * v2c (RFC 3416):
 *   - Get: noSuchObject / noSuchInstance per varbind, error-status stays 0
 *   - GetNext: endOfMibView per varbind past the end
 *   - GetBulk: non-repeaters once, then up to max-repetitions rows of the
 *     repeaters; stops early when every repeater is at endOfMibView, and
 *     returns as many varbinds as fit instead of tooBig
 *   - Set: notWritable for existing objects, noCreation for others
 *   - Response larger than the buffer: tooBig with an empty varbind list
