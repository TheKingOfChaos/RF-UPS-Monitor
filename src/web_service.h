/**
 * @file web_service.h
 * @brief The configuration web page on TCP port 80 (lib/web_ui does the parsing,
 *        login and pages; this file connects it to the network and the device).
 *
 * One connection at a time, fully non-blocking: the request is read as it
 * arrives, the response is written only as fast as the TCP send buffer takes
 * it, and a connection that does not finish within WEB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS
 * is closed. SNMP is served in between, so a slow or hostile browser cannot
 * stall the agent.
 *
 * Login: user "admin". Until a password is set with serial menu option 6 the
 * device default password is used: 10 random characters generated once and
 * kept in data/web_default.txt (not touched by a factory reset), shown only
 * on the serial status screen.
